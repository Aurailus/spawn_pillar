# Spawn Pillar
A mod for minetest public servers that adds multiple spawnpoints.

256 spawnpoints are distributed around the center 32000 blocks squared. Each spawnpoint has a spawn-pillar at it that allows you to select a different spawnpoint. This mod is helpful for public servers to avoid spawn-griefing.
