A mod for Minetest public servers that adds multiple spawnpoints.

This mod distributes 256 spawnpoints evenly around the center 32000 blocks of the minetest world. Each spawnpoint has a spawn-pillar which allows players to bind to a different spawnpoint. This mod is helpful for public servers wanting to avoid spawn-griefing.
